"""Meta-frame — audits the question itself before spending on the 9 advisors.

v0.6 design: gpt-5 [OpenAI] runs cross-lab audit on the question + canonical
context. If the question is exploration disguised as decision, or a proxy for
the real question, the meta-frame recommends reformulation and the server
short-circuits the run before the 9 frames fire. This saves ~$1.50 per
malformed run.

The full implementation of ``evaluate_question_quality`` lands in Task 4.2.

Classify along four axes:

1. decision_class: one of
   - "reversible": the user can undo this in <30 days at <10% of the cost
   - "one-way-door": effectively irreversible (closing a company, public commitment, contract signed)
   - "two-way-with-cost": reversible but costly (months and meaningful capital to undo)

2. urgency: one of
   - "now": material adverse outcome if not decided in days
   - "weeks": meaningful change-of-state in weeks
   - "months": months of runway before forced
   - "fake-urgency": the user feels urgency that the situation does not actually warrant

3. question_quality: one of
   - "well-formed": binary or small-N decision with clear stakes and stated criteria
   - "proxy-for-other-question": the named question is a stand-in for a deeper unspoken one
   - "exploration-disguised-as-decision": the user is still gathering information, not deciding

4. meta_recommendation: one of
   - "proceed": the 9 advisors should run as-is
   - "reformulate": offer the user a sharper version of the question first
   - "postpone": the user lacks information they could gather cheaply before deciding
   - "this-is-not-a-decision": the question is asking for explanation/exploration, not a commit

If meta_recommendation is "reformulate", set suggested_reformulation to a single-sentence rewrite of the question that would be well-formed.

Output STRICT JSON. No prose. No markdown fence. Exact shape:
{
  "decision_class": "<one of above>",
  "urgency": "<one of above>",
  "question_quality": "<one of above>",
  "suggested_reformulation": "<sentence>" or null,
