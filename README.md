# Henge · 9 advisors. 1 mandatory dissenter.

![Henge](docs/header-v2.jpg)

Ten pillars.
Nine align.
One must disagree.

Henge is an MCP server that measures AI consensus and forces a steel-man counter-argument before you act. Built for humans making serious decisions with AI in the loop — also drivable by autonomous agents.

## Quickstart · Claude Code (30s)

Paste this prompt into Claude Code and it self-installs by running a deterministic shell script — no LLM step-following, no drift:

````
Install Henge from https://github.com/ChrisPiz/Henge. Idempotent flow:

1. Clone shallow (or pull if already there):
   git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/ChrisPiz/Henge.git ~/Henge \
     || (cd ~/Henge && git pull --ff-only)

2. cd ~/Henge && cp -n .env.example .env

3. Ask me for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY one at a time. When I paste each one, update the matching line in ~/Henge/.env in-place. Confirm only the LENGTH back to me ("got it, 108 chars") — never echo the value to the chat or any other tool.

4. Run the setup script — it handles Python ≥3.11 (with a 15-minute pyenv install fallback if missing), the venv, the editable install, the cross-cwd sanity check, key validation, MCP registration for every host installed (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor), and the /decide slash command:
   cd ~/Henge && ./setup

5. When the script prints "✓ Henge installed.", tell me to fully quit Claude Code (close ALL terminals running `claude`) and reopen, then try `/decide should I take the new job?`.
````

Restart Claude Code fully when it's done, then try:

```
/decide should I take the new job?
```

> **Note:** the `/decide` slash command is **Claude Code only**. In Claude Desktop and Cursor, MCP tools don't appear as slash commands — you invoke Henge by writing your question normally ("Should I quit my job to start a company?") and Claude picks up the `decide` tool from its description, or you can mention it explicitly ("use the decide tool to analyze ...").

For Claude Desktop, Cursor or any other MCP host, see [Manual install](#manual-install) at the bottom.

## The problem

AI systems don't fail because they lack intelligence.

They fail because:
- they converge too fast
- they reinforce assumptions
- they mistake agreement for truth

Consensus is cheap. Correct decisions are not.

---

## What Henge does

![Disagreement map — tenth-man pulled to d=1.074, nine cluster around the centroid](docs/disagreement-map.png)

Henge runs your question through ten cognitive perspectives and:

1. Asks 4–7 scoping questions before reasoning, so the advisors apply to facts instead of speculation
2. Runs nine cognitive frames in parallel — each with its own lens
3. Embeds the answers, projects them with classical MDS, and measures cosine distance to the centroid of the nine
4. Forces a tenth advisor to steel-man the dissent against whatever consensus emerged
5. Persists a full HTML report + JSON record on disk and opens it in your browser

---

## Why this is different

| Approach              | Problem                       | Henge                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Single LLM            | Overconfident answers         | Multi-frame reasoning              |
| Multi-agent debate    | Noisy, redundant              | Measures structure, doesn't echo   |
| Devil's advocate      | Always contradicts            | Tenth-man only when warranted      |
| Fixed "tenth man" rule| Hard-coded contrarian         | Steel-man with measurable distance |

---

## Core principle

![Nine advisors aligned · the tenth must dissent — verdict, distances, and the dissent that landed](docs/report-banner.png)

Forcing disagreement without consensus is noise.

Henge does not simulate debate. It analyzes the structure of thought, then quantifies the distance between voices so the dissent has somewhere to land.

---

## Before you install

Quick checklist so the install doesn't surprise you:

- **Python ≥3.11.** macOS still ships Python 3.9. The Claude Code paste prompt detects this and installs Python 3.11.9 via pyenv automatically (no admin/sudo, but the build takes ~10 min the first time).
- **Two API keys.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (mandatory — runs the 10 advisors) and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (embedding provider).
- **Restart Claude Code fully after install.** Close ALL terminals running `claude`, then reopen. The MCP catalog is loaded once at startup; a running session will never pick up a freshly-registered server.

---

## How it works

```

│ disagreement map + report     │
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

The verdict is one of three states:

- **aligned-stable** — the nine cluster tightly and the tenth's dissent is moderate
- **aligned-fragile** — the nine are tight but the tenth pushes far enough to break it coherently
- **divided** — the nine themselves are spread; there was no real consensus to attack

---

## Cognitive frames

Nine consensus frames + one mandatory dissenter:

| # | Frame              | Lens                                                      |
|---|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | empirical          | quantification, base rates, [assumption] markers          |
| 2 | historical         | precedents — what happened the last 3–5 times             |
| 3 | first-principles   | reduce to physical / economic / logical atoms             |
| 4 | analogical         | cross-domain mappings (biology, military, finance)        |
| 5 | systemic           | feedback loops, second- and third-order effects           |
| 6 | ethical            | deontological + consequentialist tension                  |
| 7 | soft-contrarian    | surgical reframe of the loaded silent assumption          |
| 8 | radical-optimist   | what unlocks if it goes 10× better                        |
| 9 | pre-mortem         | assume it failed in 12 months — describe how              |
| 10| **tenth-man**      | steel-man dissent, mandatory, after the nine align        |

All frames respond in the **same language as the question** (Spanish question → Spanish answer; English → English). The report chrome (headings, labels, reading guide) follows the same rule by auto-detecting the question's language; force a single locale with `HENGE_LOCALE=en` or `HENGE_LOCALE=es` in your `.env`.

## Models & costs

| Stage              | Model                | Why                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Scoping            | Claude Haiku 4.5     | fast, cheap, ~3–5 s per call       |
| 9 cognitive frames | Claude Sonnet 4.6    | quality reasoning, parallel        |
| Consensus synthesis| Claude Haiku 4.5     | summarization, structured output   |
| Tenth-man dissent  | Claude Opus 4.7      | hardest reasoning, fully sequential|
| Embeddings         | OpenAI               | `text-embedding-3-small` by default|

Typical cost per full run: **~USD 0.65** (range USD 0.50–0.80 depending on token spread).

---

## Use cases

- founder & operator decisions
- hiring / scaling / firing
- product strategy and prioritization
- risk analysis & pre-mortems
- counterfactual reasoning
- AI agent orchestration where you need a structured second opinion

---

## What this is NOT

- not a chatbot
- not a debate simulator
- not a multi-agent chat
- not a vibe-checker

It is a **decision-quality** tool. The output is a measurable structure of agreement and disagreement, not a longer answer.

---

## Roadmap

- numeric consensus-strength scoring
- dissent-impact scoring
- adaptive frame selection (only run the lenses that matter)
- PDF / shareable web report
- streaming results
- multi-model support (Gemini, GPT, local)
- local embeddings (sentence-transformers, no API key required)

---

## Design philosophy

- don't generate more answers → generate better structure
- don't simulate intelligence → measure it
- don't force dissent → earn it

---

## Mental model

Henge is not trying to be right.

It is trying to make your thinking harder to break.

# Developer reference

Everything below is for integrators and developers. The [Quickstart](#quickstart--claude-code-30s) at the top is enough for normal use.

## Manual install

| Client          | Install                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Claude Code     | One-shot — see [Quickstart](#quickstart--claude-code-30s) |
| Claude Desktop  | Manual config edit                               |
| Cursor          | Manual config edit                               |
| Anything else   | Manual `pip install -e .` + run as MCP server    |

All paths reach the same MCP server and call the same `decide` tool. Reports persist at `~/.henge/reports/` and the browseable `index.html` ledger auto-regenerates on every run.

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) and add the `henge` block under `mcpServers`. The server loads `~/Henge/.env` automatically, so `cwd` and inline `env` are not required:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "henge": {
      "command": "/Users/<you>/Henge/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "henge.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use the absolute path to the venv's Python — `~` is not expanded by every host. Quit Claude Desktop fully with **Cmd+Q** (closing the window only hides it; the process keeps running and won't reread the config) and reopen.

After restart, **Claude Desktop requires you to approve the new connector** before it actually starts the server. Open **Settings → Connectors** (or Extensions, depending on the version), find `henge` in the list, and enable/approve it. Editing the config file is not enough on its own. Once approved, the tool is available in any chat — but it does **not** show up as a `/decide` slash command. Ask your decision question in natural language ("Should I hire someone now?") and Claude will pick up the `decide` tool, or invoke it explicitly ("use the decide tool to analyze ...").

### Cursor

Add the same `mcpServers.henge` block to Cursor's MCP config (`Settings → MCP → Edit`).

### Any environment

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/ChrisPiz/Henge.git ~/Henge
cd ~/Henge
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  (required — runs the 9 frames + tenth-man)
#   OPENAI_API_KEY     (embedding provider)

./setup                  # does Python detection, venv, pip install -e .,
                         # key validation, MCP registration, slash command
```

The `setup` script handles every step deterministically. If you'd rather run the pieces yourself: `python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e .` then register the MCP with your host of choice.

### Setup script flags (optional)

The Quickstart paste runs `./setup` with no flags — the script auto-detects every MCP host on the machine (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor) and registers Henge for each. Use these flags only to override that default.

```bash
./setup                          # default — auto-detect installed hosts (what the Quickstart runs)
./setup --host claude-code       # register only for Claude Code
./setup --host claude-desktop    # register only for Claude Desktop
./setup --host cursor            # register only for Cursor
./setup --host all               # register for every host even if not detected
./setup --skip-validate          # skip the API-key validation step
```

## Tool API

### `decide(question, context=None, skip_scoping=False)`

Two-phase. Phase 1 returns clarifying questions; phase 2 runs the ten advisors with the answers as context.

#### Phase 1 — scoping (default)

```jsonc
// call
{ "question": "Should I hire someone now?" }

// response
{
  "status": "needs_context",
  "questions": [
    "What is your approximate net monthly income?",
    "What's your runway in months?",
    "Is the role revenue-generating or cost-saving?",
    "..."
  ],
  "next_call_hint": "decide(question='...', context='<user answers formatted>')"
}
```

#### Phase 2 — run

```jsonc
// call
{
  "question": "Should I hire someone now?",
  "context": "Net income USD 2.6K / month, runway 8 months, role: senior engineer, ..."
}

// response: full disagreement-map JSON (see `Output structure` below)
```

#### Skip scoping

```jsonc
{ "question": "...", "skip_scoping": true }   // when the question already has rich context
```

---

## Example usage (agent)

```ts
const phase1 = await mcp.tools.decide({
  question: "Should I expand my business?"
})
// phase1.questions → present to user, collect answers

const phase2 = await mcp.tools.decide({
  question: "Should I expand my business?",
  context: "Revenue USD 2.6K, expenses 550, 8 months runway, ..."
})
// phase2.viz_path → opens HTML
// phase2.summary.consensus_state → drives downstream agent logic
```

---

## Output structure

```jsonc
{
  "viz_path": "/Users/you/.henge/reports/20260501-2247_should-i-hire-now/report.html",
  "report_id": "20260501-2247_should-i-hire-now",
  "report_dir": "/Users/you/.henge/reports/20260501-2247_should-i-hire-now",
  "consensus": "# Validate before hiring — asymmetric risk dominates\n\n## (1) Where the nine converge ...",
  "frames": [
    { "frame": "empirical",        "status": "ok", "distance": 0.046, "summary": "..." },
    { "frame": "first-principles", "status": "ok", "distance": 0.069, "summary": "..." }
    // 7 more
  ],
  "tenth_man": {
    "distance": 0.148,
    "response": "## §1 Facts I accept\n... ## §2 Where the consensus fails ..."
  },
  "summary": {
    "tenth_man_distance": 0.148,
    "max_frame_distance": 0.085,
    "consensus_state": "aligned-stable",       // or "aligned-fragile" | "divided"
    "consensus_fragility": "Advisors aligned — dissent sounds reasonable but consensus holds.",
    "n_frames_succeeded": 9,
    "embed_provider": "openai",
    "embed_model": "text-embedding-3-small"
  },
  "cost_usd": 0.65
}
```

The HTML at `viz_path` ships with the disagreement map, sortable frames table, consensus card, tenth-man steel-man, and a per-run hero painting bundled inside `report_dir/assets/`.

---

## Reports & ledger

Each run writes:

```
~/.henge/reports/
  20260501-224712_should-i-hire-now/
    report.html       # full editorial visualization
    report.json       # canonical record (question, context, 10 responses, distances, summary)
    assets/
      header-v2.jpg   # bundled hero painting
  index.html          # auto-regenerated ledger of every past report
```

The JSON is the source of truth. The HTML is a pure render of it — delete a directory and it disappears from the ledger on the next run.

---

```

---

## Embeddings · provider config

Henge needs to compute distance between the 10 advisor responses to draw the disagreement map, and that requires **embeddings** (text → vector). Anthropic does not currently offer an embeddings API, so a second provider is unavoidable for the math layer.

**OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`** — ~USD 0.0005/run. Most devs already have a key.

A local-embeddings option (no API key, sentence-transformers on-device) is on the [Roadmap](#roadmap).

---

## MCP integration

Henge speaks Model Context Protocol. Any MCP-compatible client can drive it as a reasoning tool.

Tested with:

- **Claude Code** (one-shot install)
- **Claude Desktop** (manual config)
- **Cursor** (manual config)
- Any other MCP-compatible agent or local AI pipeline

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| `/decide` says "Henge MCP server doesn't appear to be connected" | Quit every `claude` session and reopen. If still failing → next row. |
| `claude mcp list` shows `henge ✗ Failed` | Run `~/Henge/.venv/bin/python -m henge.server </dev/null` interactively to see the real error. Most common cause: the editable install was skipped — `cd ~/Henge && .venv/bin/pip install -e .` and re-register. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'henge'` | Editable install missing. `cd ~/Henge && .venv/bin/pip install -e .` |
| `git clone` fails with "destination already exists" | The repo is already there. `cd ~/Henge && git pull --ff-only`. |
| `pyenv install` shows an `lzma` warning | Non-fatal, ignore. (Optional cleanup: `brew install xz` and re-run.) |
| Server validates keys then exits immediately | Expected. It's a stdio MCP server; without a client on stdin, it shuts down once `✓ keys validated` is printed. |
| `claude mcp add` rejects the path with $HOME | Pass an absolute path: `~/Henge/.venv/bin/python` (Claude Code expands `~`, but other shells re-expand `$HOME` after registration). |
