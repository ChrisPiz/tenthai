# Henge · 9 advisors. 1 mandatory dissenter.

![Henge](docs/header-v2.jpg)

Ten pillars.
Nine align.
One must disagree.

Henge is an MCP server that measures AI consensus and forces a steel-man counter-argument before you act. Built for humans making serious decisions with AI in the loop — also drivable by autonomous agents.

**[→ See a live demo report](https://chrispiz.github.io/Henge-MCP/demo.html)**

---

## The problem

AI systems don't fail because they lack intelligence.

They fail because:
- they converge too fast
- they reinforce assumptions
- they mistake agreement for truth

Consensus is cheap. Correct decisions are not.

---

## What Henge does

Henge runs your question through ten cognitive perspectives and:

1. Asks 4–7 scoping questions before reasoning, so the advisors apply to facts instead of speculation
2. Runs nine cognitive frames in parallel — each with its own lens
3. Embeds the answers, projects them with classical MDS, and measures cosine distance to the centroid of the nine
4. Forces a tenth advisor to steel-man the dissent against whatever consensus emerged
5. Persists a full HTML report + JSON record on disk and opens it in your browser

---

## Why this is different

| Approach              | Problem                       | Henge                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Single LLM            | Overconfident answers         | Multi-frame reasoning              |
| Multi-agent debate    | Noisy, redundant              | Measures structure, doesn't echo   |
| Devil's advocate      | Always contradicts            | Tenth-man only when warranted      |
| Fixed "tenth man" rule| Hard-coded contrarian         | Steel-man with measurable distance |

---

## Core principle

Forcing disagreement without consensus is noise.

Henge does not simulate debate. It analyzes the structure of thought, then quantifies the distance between voices so the dissent has somewhere to land.

---

## Quickstart (30s)

If you have **Claude Code** installed, paste this prompt and it self-installs:

````
Install Henge from https://github.com/ChrisPiz/Henge-MCP into ~/Henge. The whole flow MUST be idempotent — if any step was done by a previous attempt, detect it and continue, do NOT fail on "directory already exists", "venv already exists", or "MCP already registered".

STEP 1 — Source at ~/Henge
- If ~/Henge does not exist or is empty: `git clone https://github.com/ChrisPiz/Henge-MCP.git ~/Henge`.
- If ~/Henge exists with a .git pointing at ChrisPiz/Henge-MCP: `cd ~/Henge && git pull --ff-only`.
- If ~/Henge exists but is something else: stop and ask the user what to do.

STEP 2 — Python ≥3.11
- Try in this order, pick the first that works, save the absolute path to a variable named PY: `python3.13`, `python3.12`, `python3.11`, then any `~/.pyenv/versions/3.11.*/bin/python3.11`.
- If none exist, install one WITHOUT requiring sudo:
  (a) if `brew` is on PATH: `brew install python@3.11`.
  (b) else: `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`, then `export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv" && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH" && eval "$(pyenv init -)" && pyenv install 3.11.9`. The pyenv install can take ~10 min — use a 900s (15 min) timeout for that single Bash call. A `lzma` warning at the end is non-fatal, ignore it. Set PY to `$HOME/.pyenv/versions/3.11.9/bin/python3.11`.
- Confirm `"$PY" --version` prints `Python 3.11.x` or higher before continuing.

STEP 3 — Virtualenv + editable install
- `cd ~/Henge`.
- If `~/Henge/.venv/bin/python` does not exist: `"$PY" -m venv .venv`.
- `~/Henge/.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip` (quiet).
- `~/Henge/.venv/bin/pip install -e .`  ← REQUIRED. Without the editable install the `henge` package is not registered in the venv and the MCP server crashes with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'henge'` whenever it is spawned from a cwd other than ~/Henge.
- Cross-cwd sanity check: `cd /tmp && ~/Henge/.venv/bin/python -c "import henge; print('ok')"` MUST print `ok`. If it fails, redo step 3 from the top.

STEP 4 — API keys (NEVER echo them back to the chat)
- If ~/Henge/.env does not exist: `cp ~/Henge/.env.example ~/Henge/.env`.
- Ask the user for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. When they paste it, update the line `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` in ~/Henge/.env using a single in-place replacement. CONFIRM ONLY THE LENGTH ("got it, 108 chars") — never paste the value back into the chat or any tool input.
- Repeat for OPENAI_API_KEY. (If the user prefers Voyage: ask for VOYAGE_API_KEY instead, set EMBED_PROVIDER=voyage in .env, leave OPENAI_API_KEY blank.)
- Optional: ask whether to force `HENGE_LOCALE=en` or `es` (else auto-detected from each question). If yes, append the line.

STEP 5 — Validate the keys
- Run: `cd ~/Henge && (timeout 5 ./.venv/bin/python -m henge.server </dev/null) 2>&1 | head -20`. (On macOS without coreutils, use `gtimeout` or fall back to `( ./.venv/bin/python -m henge.server </dev/null & sleep 5; kill $! 2>/dev/null )`.)
- SUCCESS = the output contains `✓ keys validated`. The process exiting after that line is expected (stdio MCP server with closed stdin). Treat any auth error, traceback, or missing-key message as FAILURE and stop with a clear explanation.

STEP 6 — Register the MCP
- If `claude mcp list` already lists `henge`: `claude mcp remove henge` first.
- Register with an ABSOLUTE path (not $HOME — expand it now): `claude mcp add -s user henge -- "$HOME/Henge/.venv/bin/python" -m henge.server`.
- `claude mcp list` again. The `henge` row MUST show `✓ Connected`. If it shows ✗ Failed, run `~/Henge/.venv/bin/python -m henge.server </dev/null` once interactively, capture the stderr, and stop with that error.

STEP 7 — /decide slash command
- `mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands`.
- Write ~/.claude/commands/decide.md with EXACTLY this content (front matter included, no extra wrapping):
  ---
  description: Invokes Henge — disagreement map of 9 advisors + 1 dissenter.
  ---
  Use the `decide` MCP tool from the `henge` server to analyze: $ARGUMENTS.

  If the response is `status: "needs_context"`: present the `questions` to the user as a numbered list, then add a final line saying they can skip these and run immediately by replying "skip" (or "omitir" / "corre ya"). On that reply, call `decide` again with `skip_scoping=True`. Otherwise, call `decide` again with `context` set to their answers.

  When the full JSON returns (status absent): cite `viz_path`, summarize the `consensus` first, list the 9 advisors' conclusions, then quote `tenth_man.response` verbatim.

STEP 8 — Hand-off
- Print a one-line summary: Python version used, embed provider (openai/voyage), MCP status (Connected).
- Tell the user to fully quit Claude Code (close ALL terminal sessions running `claude`) and reopen — the MCP catalog is loaded once at startup, so a running session won't see the new server. Then try `/decide should I take the new job?`.
````

Restart Claude Code once when it's done, then try:

```
/decide should I take the new job?
```

For Claude Desktop, Cursor, or a manual setup, see the [Install matrix](#install-matrix) below.

## Install matrix

| Client          | Install                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Claude Code     | One-shot — see [Quickstart](#quickstart-30s)     |
| Claude Desktop  | Manual config edit                               |
| Cursor          | Manual config edit                               |
| Anything else   | Manual `pip install -e .` + run as MCP server    |

All paths reach the same MCP server and call the same `decide` tool. Reports persist at `~/.henge/reports/` and the browseable `index.html` ledger auto-regenerates on every run.

### Claude Desktop · manual

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "henge": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "henge.server"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/Henge-MCP",
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "...",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor · manual

Add the same `mcpServers.henge` block to Cursor's MCP config (`Settings → MCP → Edit`).

### Manual install (any environment)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChrisPiz/Henge-MCP.git
cd Henge-MCP
pip install -e .

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  (required — runs the 9 frames + tenth-man)
#   OPENAI_API_KEY     (default embedding provider)
#   VOYAGE_API_KEY     (optional — set EMBED_PROVIDER=voyage for higher quality)

python -m henge.server   # runs as an MCP stdio server
```

---

## Before you install

Quick checklist so the install doesn't surprise you:

- **Python ≥3.11.** macOS still ships Python 3.9. The Claude Code paste prompt detects this and installs Python 3.11.9 via pyenv automatically (no admin/sudo, but the build takes ~10 min the first time).
- **Two API keys.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (mandatory — runs the 10 advisors) and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (default embedding provider). Voyage is an alternative — see [Embeddings · why a second provider?](#embeddings--why-a-second-provider).
- **`pip install -e .` is mandatory.** Not `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The editable install registers the `henge` package inside the venv. Without it, the MCP server crashes with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'henge'` whenever it's spawned from a cwd other than `~/Henge` — which is exactly what an MCP host does.
- **Restart Claude Code fully after install.** Close ALL terminals running `claude`, then reopen. The MCP catalog is loaded once at startup; a running session will never pick up a freshly-registered server.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| `/decide` says "Henge MCP server doesn't appear to be connected" | Quit every `claude` session and reopen. If still failing → next row. |
| `claude mcp list` shows `henge ✗ Failed` | Run `~/Henge/.venv/bin/python -m henge.server </dev/null` interactively to see the real error. Most common cause: the editable install was skipped — `cd ~/Henge && .venv/bin/pip install -e .` and re-register. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'henge'` | Editable install missing. `cd ~/Henge && .venv/bin/pip install -e .` |
| `git clone` fails with "destination already exists" | The repo is already there. `cd ~/Henge && git pull --ff-only`. |
| `pyenv install` shows an `lzma` warning | Non-fatal, ignore. (Optional cleanup: `brew install xz` and re-run.) |
| Server validates keys then exits immediately | Expected. It's a stdio MCP server; without a client on stdin, it shuts down once `✓ keys validated` is printed. |
| `claude mcp add` rejects the path with $HOME | Pass an absolute path: `~/Henge/.venv/bin/python` (Claude Code expands `~`, but other shells re-expand `$HOME` after registration). |

---

## MCP integration

Henge speaks Model Context Protocol. Any MCP-compatible client can drive it as a reasoning tool.

Tested with:

- **Claude Code** (one-shot install)
- **Claude Desktop** (manual config)
- **Cursor** (manual config)
- Any other MCP-compatible agent or local AI pipeline

---

## Tool API

### `decide(question, context=None, skip_scoping=False)`

Two-phase. Phase 1 returns clarifying questions; phase 2 runs the ten advisors with the answers as context.

#### Phase 1 — scoping (default)

```jsonc
// call
{ "question": "Should I hire someone now?" }

// response
{
  "status": "needs_context",
  "questions": [
    "What is your approximate net monthly income?",
    "What's your runway in months?",
    "Is the role revenue-generating or cost-saving?",
    "..."
  ],
  "next_call_hint": "decide(question='...', context='<user answers formatted>')"
}
```

#### Phase 2 — run

```jsonc
// call
{
  "question": "Should I hire someone now?",
  "context": "Net income USD 2.6K / month, runway 8 months, role: senior engineer, ..."
}

// response: full disagreement-map JSON (see `Output structure` below)
```

#### Skip scoping

```jsonc
{ "question": "...", "skip_scoping": true }   // when the question already has rich context
```

---

## Example usage (agent)

```ts
const phase1 = await mcp.tools.decide({
  question: "Should I expand my business?"
})
// phase1.questions → present to user, collect answers

const phase2 = await mcp.tools.decide({
  question: "Should I expand my business?",
  context: "Revenue USD 2.6K, expenses 550, 8 months runway, ..."
})
// phase2.viz_path → opens HTML
// phase2.summary.consensus_state → drives downstream agent logic
```

---

## Output structure

```jsonc
{
  "viz_path": "/Users/you/.henge/reports/20260501-2247_should-i-hire-now/report.html",
  "report_id": "20260501-2247_should-i-hire-now",
  "report_dir": "/Users/you/.henge/reports/20260501-2247_should-i-hire-now",
  "consensus": "# Validate before hiring — asymmetric risk dominates\n\n## (1) Where the nine converge ...",
  "frames": [
    { "frame": "empirical",        "status": "ok", "distance": 0.046, "summary": "..." },
    { "frame": "first-principles", "status": "ok", "distance": 0.069, "summary": "..." }
    // 7 more
  ],
  "tenth_man": {
    "distance": 0.148,
    "response": "## §1 Facts I accept\n... ## §2 Where the consensus fails ..."
  },
  "summary": {
    "tenth_man_distance": 0.148,
    "max_frame_distance": 0.085,
    "consensus_state": "aligned-stable",       // or "aligned-fragile" | "divided"
    "consensus_fragility": "Advisors aligned — dissent sounds reasonable but consensus holds.",
    "n_frames_succeeded": 9,
    "embed_provider": "openai",
    "embed_model": "text-embedding-3-small"
  },
  "cost_usd": 0.65
}
```

The HTML at `viz_path` ships with the disagreement map, sortable frames table, consensus card, tenth-man steel-man, and a per-run hero painting bundled inside `report_dir/assets/`.

---

## Reports & ledger

Each run writes:

```
~/.henge/reports/
  20260501-224712_should-i-hire-now/
    report.html       # full editorial visualization
    report.json       # canonical record (question, context, 10 responses, distances, summary)
    assets/
      header-v2.jpg   # bundled hero painting
  index.html          # auto-regenerated ledger of every past report
```

The JSON is the source of truth. The HTML is a pure render of it — delete a directory and it disappears from the ledger on the next run.

---

## How it works

```

┌─ phase 1 ─────────────────────┐

```

The verdict is one of three states:

- **aligned-stable** — the nine cluster tightly and the tenth's dissent is moderate
- **aligned-fragile** — the nine are tight but the tenth pushes far enough to break it coherently
- **divided** — the nine themselves are spread; there was no real consensus to attack

---

## Cognitive frames

Nine consensus frames + one mandatory dissenter:

| # | Frame              | Lens                                                      |
|---|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | empirical          | quantification, base rates, [assumption] markers          |
| 2 | historical         | precedents — what happened the last 3–5 times             |
| 3 | first-principles   | reduce to physical / economic / logical atoms             |
| 4 | analogical         | cross-domain mappings (biology, military, finance)        |
| 5 | systemic           | feedback loops, second- and third-order effects           |
| 6 | ethical            | deontological + consequentialist tension                  |
| 7 | soft-contrarian    | surgical reframe of the loaded silent assumption          |
| 8 | radical-optimist   | what unlocks if it goes 10× better                        |
| 9 | pre-mortem         | assume it failed in 12 months — describe how              |
| 10| **tenth-man**      | steel-man dissent, mandatory, after the nine align        |

All frames respond in the **same language as the question** (Spanish question → Spanish answer; English → English). The report chrome (headings, labels, reading guide) follows the same rule by auto-detecting the question's language; force a single locale with `HENGE_LOCALE=en` or `HENGE_LOCALE=es` in your `.env`.

## Models & costs

| Stage              | Model                | Why                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Scoping            | Claude Haiku 4.5     | fast, cheap, ~3–5 s per call       |
| 9 cognitive frames | Claude Sonnet 4.6    | quality reasoning, parallel        |
| Consensus synthesis| Claude Haiku 4.5     | summarization, structured output   |
| Tenth-man dissent  | Claude Opus 4.7      | hardest reasoning, fully sequential|
| Embeddings         | OpenAI / Voyage      | `text-embedding-3-small` by default|

Typical cost per full run: **~USD 0.65** (range USD 0.50–0.80 depending on token spread).

---

## Embeddings · why a second provider?

> "If I'm using Claude, the idea is to use only Claude — right?"

Right in spirit, but Henge needs to compute distance between the 10 advisor responses to draw the disagreement map, and that requires **embeddings** (text → vector). Anthropic does not currently offer an embeddings API, so a second provider is unavoidable for the math layer that turns 10 paragraphs of reasoning into the consensus structure you see on the report.

Two options today:

| Provider | Default? | Cost | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **OpenAI** `text-embedding-3-small` | default | ~USD 0.0005/run | Cheapest. Most devs already have a key. |
| **Voyage AI** | opt-in | Free tier · 200M tokens/month (~50k runs) | Anthropic's recommended embedding partner. Better quality for Spanish. Set `EMBED_PROVIDER=voyage` + `VOYAGE_API_KEY=...` in `.env`. |

If you want to stay inside the Anthropic ecosystem with a free key, use Voyage — same effect as OpenAI, no separate billing. A local-embeddings option (no API key, sentence-transformers on-device) is on the [Roadmap](#roadmap).

---

## Architecture

```
henge/
  agents.py        # 9 frames in parallel + tenth-man sequencing
  embed.py         # provider-agnostic embeddings + classical MDS
  scoping.py       # 4–7 clarifying questions (Haiku)
  consensus.py     # synthesis of the nine (Haiku)
  viz.py           # editorial HTML report + disagreement map SVG
  storage.py       # report.json + report.html + ledger
  server.py        # MCP entrypoint
  prompts/         # 10 cognitive-frame markdowns
  assets/          # bundled hero painting
```

---

## Use cases

- founder & operator decisions
- hiring / scaling / firing
- product strategy and prioritization
- risk analysis & pre-mortems
- counterfactual reasoning
- AI agent orchestration where you need a structured second opinion

---

## What this is NOT

- not a chatbot
- not a debate simulator
- not a multi-agent chat
- not a vibe-checker

It is a **decision-quality** tool. The output is a measurable structure of agreement and disagreement, not a longer answer.

---

## Roadmap

- numeric consensus-strength scoring
- dissent-impact scoring
- adaptive frame selection (only run the lenses that matter)
- PDF / shareable web report
- streaming results
- multi-model support (Gemini, GPT, local)
- local embeddings (sentence-transformers, no API key required)

---

## Design philosophy

- don't generate more answers → generate better structure
- don't simulate intelligence → measure it
- don't force dissent → earn it

---

## Mental model

Henge is not trying to be right.

It is trying to make your thinking harder to break.
